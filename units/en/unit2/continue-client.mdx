# Using MCP with Local and Open Source Models

In this section, we'll connect MCP with local and open-source models using
Continue, a tool for building AI coding assistants that works with local tools
like Ollama.

## Setup Continue

You can install Continue from the VS Code marketplace.

<Tip>
*Continue also has an extension for JetBrains.*
</Tip>

### VS Code extension

1. Click `Install` on the [Continue extension page in the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)
2. This will open the Continue extension page in VS Code, where you will need to click `Install` again
3. The Continue logo will appear on the left sidebar. For a better experience, move Continue to the right sidebar

With Continue configured, we'll move on to setting up Ollama to pull local models.

### Ollama local models

Ollama is an open-source tool that allows users to run large language models (LLMs)
locally on their own computers. To use Ollama, you can [install](https://ollama.com/download) it and
download the model you want to run with the `ollama run` command.

For example, you can download the [llama 3.1:8b](https://ollama.com/models/llama-3:1b) model with:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

It is important that we use models that have tool calling as a built-in feature, i.e. Codestral Qwen and Llama 3.1x.

1. Create a folder called `.continue/models` at the top level of your workspace
2. Add a file called `llama-max.yaml` to this folder
3. Write the following contents to `llama-max.yaml` and save

```yaml
name: Ollama Llama model
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1
models:
  - provider: ollama
    model: llama3.1:8b
    defaultCompletionOptions:
      contextLength: 128000
    name: a llama3.1:8b max
    roles:
      - chat
      - edit
```

By default, the max context length is `8192` tokens. This setup includes a larger use of
that context window to perform multiple MCP requests and also allotment for more
tokens will be necessary.

## How it works

### The tool handshake

Tools provide a powerful way for models to interface with the external world.
They are provided to the model as a JSON object with a name and an arguments
schema. For example, a `read_file` tool with a `filepath` argument will give the
model the ability to request the contents of a specific file.

The following handshake describes how the Agent uses tools:

1. In Agent mode, available tools are sent along with `user` chat requests
2. The model can choose to include a tool call in its response
3. The user gives permission. This step is skipped if the policy for that tool is set to `Automatic`
4. Continue calls the tool using built-in functionality or the MCP server that offers that particular tool
5. Continue sends the result back to the model
6. The model responds, potentially with another tool call, and step 2 begins again

Continue supports multiple local model providers. You can use different models
for different tasks or switch models as needed. This section focuses on
local-first solutions, but Continue does work with popular providers
like OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft/Azure, Mistral, and more. You can also run
your own model provider.

### Local Model Integration with MCP

Now that we have everything set up, let's add an existing MCP server. Below is a quick example of setting up a new MCP server for use in your assistant:

1. Create a folder called `.continue/mcpServers` at the top level of your workspace
2. Add a file called `playwright-mcp.yaml` to this folder
3. Write the following contents to `playwright-mcp.yaml` and save

```yaml
name: Playwright mcpServer
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1
mcpServers:
  - name: Browser search
    command: npx
    args:
      - "@playwright/mcp@latest"
```

Now test your MCP server by prompting the following command:

```
1. Using playwright, navigate to https://news.ycombinator.com.

2. Extract the titles and URLs of the top 4 posts on the homepage.

3. Create a file named hn.txt in the root directory of the project.

4. Save this list as plain text in the hn.txt file, with each line containing the title and URL separated by a hyphen.

Do not output code or instructions—just complete the task and confirm when it is done.
```

The result will be a generated file called `hn.txt` in the current working directory.

## Conclusion

By combining Continue with local models like Llama 3.1 and MCP servers, you've
unlocked a powerful development workflow that keeps your code and data private
while leveraging cutting-edge AI capabilities. 

This setup gives you the flexibility to customize your AI assistant with
specialized tools, from web automation to file management, all running entirely
on your local machine. Ready to take your development workflow to the next
level? Start by experimenting with different MCP servers from the [Continue Hub
