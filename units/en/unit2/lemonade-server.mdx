# Local Tiny Agents with AMD NPU and iGPU Acceleration

In this section, we'll show you how to accelerate our end-to-end Tiny Agents application using AMD Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and integrated GPU (iGPU). We then enhance our end-to-end application by providing it with access to local files and creating an assistant to handle sensitive information locally, ensuring maximum privacy.

To enable this, we'll use Lemonade Server, a tool for running models locally with NPU and iGPU acceleration.

## Setup
### Setup Lemonade Server

You can install Lemonade Server on both Windows and Linux. Additional documentation can be found at [lemonade-server.ai](https://lemonade-server.ai/).

### Tiny Agents and NPX Setup

This section of the course assumes you have already installed `npx` and `Tiny Agents`. If you haven't, please refer to the [Tiny Agents](https://huggingface.co/learn/mcp-course/en/unit2/tiny-agents) section of the course. Please make sure to use `huggingface_hub[mcp]==0.33.2`.

## Running your Tiny Agents application with AMD NPU and iGPU

To run your Tiny Agents application with AMD NPU and iGPU, simply point to the MCP server we created in the [previous section](https://huggingface.co/learn/mcp-course/en/unit2/tiny-agents) to the Lemonade Server, as shown below:

<hfoptions id="agent-config">
<hfoption id="windows">

```json
{
  "model": "Qwen3-8B-GGUF",
  "endpointUrl": "http://localhost:8000/api/",
  "servers": [
    {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npx.cmd",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:7860/gradio_api/mcp/sse"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="linux">

```json
{
  "model": "Qwen3-8B-GGUF",
  "endpointUrl": "http://localhost:8000/api/",
  "servers": [
    {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:7860/gradio_api/mcp/sse"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

You can then choose from a variety of models to run on your local machine. For this example, used the [`Qwen3-8B-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF) model, which runs efficiently on AMD GPUs through Vulkan acceleration. You can find the list of models supported and even import your own models by navigating to http://localhost:8000/#model-management.

## Creating an assistant to handle sensitive information locally

![Lemonade Server Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lemonade-sdk/assets/refs/heads/main/huggingface_course/hf_lemonade.png)

Now let's enhance our end-to-end application by enabling access to local files and introducing an assistant that processes sensitive information entirely on-device. Specifically, this assistant will help us evaluate candidate resumes and support decision-making in the hiring process—all while keeping the data private and secure.

To do this, we'll use the [Desktop Commander](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP) MCP server, which allows you to run commands on your local machine and provides comprehensive file system access, terminal control, and code editing capabilities.

Let's setup a project with a basic Tiny Agent.

```bash
mkdir file-assistant
cd file-assistant
```

Let's then create a new `agent.json` file in the `file-assistant` folder.

<hfoptions id="agent-file-config">
<hfoption id="windows">

```json
{
  "model": "user.jan-nano",
  "endpointUrl": "http://localhost:8000/api/",
  "servers": [
    {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npx.cmd",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="linux">

```json
{
  "model": "user.jan-nano",
  "endpointUrl": "http://localhost:8000/api/",
  "servers": [
    {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

Finally, we have to download the `Jan Nano` model. You can do this by navigating to http://localhost:8000/#model-management, clicking on `Add a Model` and providing the following information:

```
Model Name: user.jan-nano
Checkpoint: Menlo/Jan-nano-gguf:jan-nano-4b-Q4_0.gguf
Recipe: llamacpp
```

![Custom Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lemonade-sdk/assets/refs/heads/main/huggingface_course/custom_model.png)

All done! Now let's give it a try.

### Taking it for a spin

![recording](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lemonade-sdk/assets/refs/heads/main/huggingface_course/recording.gif)

Our goal is to create an assistant that can help us handle sensitive information locally. To do this, we'll first create a job description file for our assistant to work with.

Create a file called `job_description.md` in the `file-assistant` folder.

```md

We can then run the agent with the following command:

```bash
tiny-agents run agent.json
```

You should see the following output:

```
Agent loaded with 18 tools:
 • get_config
 • set_config_value
 • read_file

 »
 ```

Now let's provide the asistant with some info to get started. 

```
» Read the contents of C:\Users\your_username\file-assistant\job_description.md
```

You should see the an output similar to the following:

```

(...)

The job description for the Senior Food Technology Engineer position emphasizes the need for a candidate who can bridge the gap between food science and artificial intelligence (...). Candidates are also expected to attend conferences and publish research on algorithmic cooking optimization.
```

<Tip>

We are using the default system prompt, which may cause the assistant to call some tools multiple times. To create a more assertive assistant, you can provide a custom `PROMPT.md` file in the same directory as your `agent.json`.

</Tip>

Great! Now let's read the candidate's resume.

```
» Inside the same folder you can find a candidates folder. Check for john_resume.md and let me know if he is a good fit for the job.
```

You should see an output similar to the following:

Woohoo! We successfully created an assistant that can help us handle sensitive information locally.

### Exploring other models and acceleration options

In the example above, the Jan-Nano model leveraged Vulkan acceleration for efficient local LLM inference on AMD GPUs. You can also try out other models and acceleration options by navigating to http://localhost:8000/#model-management or checking the [models documentation](https://lemonade-server.ai/docs/server/server_models/).

For Windows applications that require a concise context and would benefit from NPU + iGPU acceleration, you can try the Hybrid models available with Lemonade Server — optimized for AMD Ryzen AI 300 series PCs. Models such as `Llama-xLAM-2-8b-fc-r-Hybrid` are specifically fine-tuned for tool-calling and deliver fast, responsive performance!

## Conclusion

In this unit, we've shown how to accelerate our end-to-end Tiny Agents application with AMD NPU and iGPU. We've also shown how to create an assistant to handle sensitive information locally.

Now that you've learned how to leverage Lemonade Server for local model acceleration and privacy-focused applications, you can explore more examples and features in the [Lemonade GitHub repository](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade). The repository contains additional documentation, example implementations, and is actively maintained by the community.
